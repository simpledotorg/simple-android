# Tracking stories on Clubhouse

1. We track our stories in the [Clubhouse](https://app.clubhouse.io/simpledotorg)

2. There's epic(a group of stories that would come under one topic) section which includes all the stories.

3. Majorly our story labels are divided into 3 different criteria's namely "Features", "Bug", "Chore", we test them manually on PR's reviews and on
   the sandbox version of the app.

# Testing "Delivered" stories on Pivotal Tracker

1. Have a look at our [Pivotal Tracker project](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2184102). The "Current Iteration/Backlog" column contains
   the stories that are being worked on right now, and others which will be picked up as part of the current iteration.

2. Any story that has been _Delivered_ will have "Accept" and "Reject" buttons on it. These stories are ready to be tested manually, and you can do so
   on the Sandbox app.

3. Read the story card in detail to understand what was delivered. Try all the flows -- perhaps some tangential flows related to the current flow. Be
   creative!

3. _Accept_ the story if you think everything works well and looks good.

4. _Reject_ the story if you think something is wrong. Add a comment, providing as much detail as possible, on why you're rejecting the story. This
   will help the development team identify and fix the issue quickly.
