# Using the Sandbox & Demo apps

There are two environments you can use to try the system -- Sandbox and Demo.

- [Sandbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.simple.clinic.sandbox) is only accessible to the Contributors team, and you have to be
  invited to see it on the Play Store.
  - We deploy a new version of Sandbox to the Store every night, automatically.
- [Demo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.simple.clinic.staging) is publicly accessible to anyone and everyone.
  - Demo is only deployed to the store a week before a _production_ release goes out.

## How to sign up on Sandbox

* Ask someone from the Contributors team to give your Play Store email address access to the app. Unless this happens, you will not be able to find
  the app on the Store.
* Once given access, you should be able to join the [Sandbox app access program](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.simple.clinic.sandbox).
* After you've joined, you should be able to see the app [on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.simple.clinic.sandbox).
* While making a new account in the app, provide a correct phone number: you will receive a verification OTP SMS on it.
* When choosing facilities, pick any facility. It doesn't really matter.
* Tell someone from the Contributors team to _approve_ your account. Unless you get approved, no data will sync to your phone.

## How to sign up on Demo

* While making a new account in the app, provide a correct phone number: you will receive a verification OTP SMS on it.
* When choosing facilities, pick any one of "Demo Facility A", "Demo Facility B" or "Demo Facility C".
* Tell someone from the Contributors team to _approve_ your account. Unless you get approved, no data will sync to your phone.
